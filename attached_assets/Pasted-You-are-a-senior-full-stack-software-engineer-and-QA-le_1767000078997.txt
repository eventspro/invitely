You are a senior full-stack software engineer and QA lead.

I have uploaded a ZIP folder containing the full source code of this project.

Your task is to fully analyze the entire project, including frontend, backend, assets, configuration, and integrations, and prepare it to be production-ready.

✅ Core Objectives

Full Project Audit

Review every file and folder

Understand intended functionality from code, UI, and structure

Identify incomplete, broken, or missing logic

Bug Detection & Fixing

Identify all existing bugs

Fix them without breaking any existing working functionality

Ensure no regressions

Missing & Broken Functionality

Identify all missing, partially implemented, or non-working features

Fully implement and fix them

Ensure every feature behaves logically and consistently

Buttons & UI Interactions

Every button must work and perform a meaningful action

No dead buttons, placeholders, or console-only actions

All interactions must give proper user feedback (navigation, modals, messages, redirects, etc.)

Payments & Contact Rules (Very Important)

❌ DO NOT implement any online payment system

Remove or disable any existing payment gateway logic

✅ All contact and payment actions must redirect or link to:

Instagram

Telegram

Facebook

Ensure these links are properly configured and functional

Images & Assets

Identify all missing, broken, or incorrectly referenced images

Fix paths, replace missing assets if needed

Ensure all images load correctly in production

Functionality Completion

No feature should be:

Half-implemented

Broken

Non-responsive

Everything visible in the UI must work as expected

QA & Testing

Perform full QA testing:

UI/UX testing

Functional testing

Edge cases

Error handling

Fix all discovered issues

Ensure clean console (no critical errors or warnings)

Production Readiness

Ensure:

Clean, readable, and maintainable code

Proper error handling

Stable behavior across all flows

The project must be ready for production deployment when finished

🛑 Constraints

Do NOT remove features unless absolutely necessary

Do NOT introduce new paid services or APIs

Preserve original project intent and design

Prefer fixing and completing over rewriting

📋 Final Deliverables

Fully working project

All bugs fixed

All buttons functional

All images loading

No online payment system

Social media–based contact/payment flow

QA-tested and production-ready
